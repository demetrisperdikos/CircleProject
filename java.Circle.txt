Given the class Point below, define a class Circle that represent a circle with a given center and radius. The Circle class should have a center attribute named center as well as a floating point radius The center is a point object, defined by the class Point. The class should also have these members:
the constructor of the class, which should take parameters to initialize all attributes
a getter for each instance data
a setter for each instance data
a toString() method that returns the summary of a Circle object
public class Point
{
    private int x, y;

    public Point(int newX, int newY)
    {
       x = newX;
       y = newY;
    }
    public String toString()
    {
       return "x:"+x+","+"y:"+y;
    }
    public double distance(Point other)
    {
       return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(x-other.x,2)+Math.pow(y-other.y,2));
     }
}
 

Write an application CircleTest that first creates two Points objects, point1 with random coordinates from 1 to 10, inclusive, and point2 with coordinates 0,0. The program will then instantiate two circles with the following radius/center requirements:
Radius entered from the keyboard and point2 as the center
Radius 5.5 and point1 as the center
     The program prints to the screen the summary of each circle as well as the distance between their centers (for full credit, you  MUST use the circle  objects).
